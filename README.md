## st_handeye_graph

This package provides a general hand-eye calibration method which can be applied to pinhole and source-detector camera models.

### Description

Unlike usual hand-eye calibration techniques, this method directly takes the images of the calibration pattern (like chessboard) and estimates the hand-eye transformation and the pattern pose such that the projection error of the pattern is minimized. Since it doesn't rely on algorithms dedicated for pinhole cameras, such as PnP algorithms, it can be easily adapted to different camera model by changing only the projection model.


### Dependencies

- g2o
- VISP
- handeye_calib_camodocal (optional, for only evaluation)


### Usage

Include "st_handeye/st_handeye.hpp" and call "st_handeye::spatial_calibration_graph()". See "st_handeye.hpp" for the details.

### Reproduce figures

```bash
git clone https://github.com/koide3/st_handeye_graph.git
git clone https://bitbucket.org/koide3/st_handeye_eval.git

mkdir st_handeye_graph/build
cd st_handeye_graph/build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j4

cd ../scripts
# run simulations and plot figures
./run_simulation.sh

# run calibration on real data and perform 3d reconstruction
./run_calibration.sh

# see the reconstructed point cloud
pcl_viewer data/points_3d_graph.pcd

## Note

This repository was combined with the [calibrate.py](https://github.com/RMDLO/zed_ws/blob/main/src/val_zed_deploy/node/calibrate.py) script to automatically collect and save calibration images.
